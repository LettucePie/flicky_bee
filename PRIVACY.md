**Privacy Policy**

This is a Free and Open Source application made under the GNU General PUblic License v3.0

There was a version of this app available on the Google PlayStore which included a one time in-app-purchase called "Supporter". This "Supporter" purchase unlocked an accessory available for the player to Enable or Disable. The Accessory could be described as dollar bills and coins raining down from the Bee that the player controls.

Because of this optional purchase, and the terms of service for applications on the Google PlayStore and Apple AppStore, there was a thoroughly jargon'd Privacy Policy hosted here on the game's repository. Since I (LettucePie) have unpublished Flicky Bee (this game/application/project) from both Google PlayStore and Apple AppStore indefinitely, I no longer need that old version of the Privacy Policy.

Here is my current Privacy Statement.

This is a Free and Open Source game, made entirely with Free and Open Source tools. Those Tools are also using Free and Open Source components (commonly known as libraries). I have no idea if at any point, the tools I used, or the libraries those tools depend on have implemented any sort of data collecting techniques. It's widely assumed that no such thing has happened, and since all of these things are fully transparent, no such thing will happen.

I myself have made no changes in my own developement of this game that collect any sort of data. To be honest, I don't even know how.

The old redundant Privacy Policy is hosted on the Github Repo (www.github.com/lettucepie/flicky_bee) as "PRIVACY_redacted"
